That way, you can decide which version/s you want to download \n \nTesting Apps – when you install a modded app, you can leave a comment that tells the moderators whether it works or not, whether any improvements are needed, if there are any issues, and so on",

You can update your apps by following the directions in the notifications or by checking the store on a regular basis and installing any available updates. \nAs far as HappyMod goes, when the store is updated to a newer version, you do NOT have to install it. You can choose to run an older version, something you cannot do with the PlayStore – if you don’t update that, the store will not work. You will also find a NEW section in HappyMod, where you can see the latest additions and updates.",

Not only are you getting an app store full of modified and cracked apps for free, but you can also join in – if you find a modded app on the internet that you think should be included, upload it to the store. Provided it passes the safety and security checks, it will be added for other users to try out. The best games and apps are placed first in the lists, ensuring you download fully working content. \nHappyMod is the newest Android app store, offering a unique experience. Give it a go today and let the developers know your thoughts.",
